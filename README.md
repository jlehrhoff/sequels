This repo contains an ipython notebook with code for scraping 3 websites:

the-numbers.com - daily box office receipts
rottentomatoes.com - movie ratings
boxofficemojo.com - lifetime box office receipts

Code to create seaborn visualizations is included.

Within the subfolder "shinyapp" are R files with to run a shiny app for interactive visualizations.
The raw data, exported from the ipython notebook as csv's, are in the folder "data."
The folder www contains some jpgs and pngs that appear in the app.

Finally, there is a brief presentation that complements the shiny app.
